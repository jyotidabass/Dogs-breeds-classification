## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The project goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed.
For this purpose, I built an image classification model with convolutional neural networks.
The model could be used as part of a mobile or web app. 
The model accepts any user-supplied image as input. 
If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. 
If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 
The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
- dog_app.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook, contains the whole project code to create a dog breed classifier.
- The images folder includes all images used for this project.
- The saved_models folder contains the models saved during this project

## Results <a name="results"></a>
I applied the model on 6 samples, 2 dogs, 2 human, and 2 others. 
The model was able to determine whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither. 
- It predicted the correct dog breed for both dogs.

- When I entered Sandra Bullock face, it resembled her with Maltese dog breed.

- When I entered a flower image, it didnâ€™t recognize it as a dog or a human.
